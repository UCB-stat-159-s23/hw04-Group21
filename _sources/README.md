For this assignment, we will start from the conclusion of HW02 and continue improving the structure of your repository as a Reproducible Research Package, using again the code from the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial. In this assignment we are giving you as a starting point effectively the solution to HW02, and you will now add a bit more structure, tests, documentation, etc, to complete the picture.
